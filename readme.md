Covered Python from Scratch
Each topic is interesting and includes special tasks related to learning assignments.
Reach out to the Ai_levels.py file in Python_58 repository to get started.

The path I have been following is as follows:
Step 1: Started learning Python completely from scratch
Step 2: To make it more interesting, started with Codedex.io
       -Reached out to Learn Python and completed all the free available tasks within a day
Step 4: Open W3Schools and started covering remaining basic topicsâ€”no need to waste time on writing notes, as all basics are covered in the tasks found here (along with questions and answers)
Step 5: Again, refer to the Ai_levels.py file in this repository

Refer to Take U Forward for LeetCode practice.
